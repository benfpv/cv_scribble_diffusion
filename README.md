# cv_scribble_diffusion
cv_scribble_diffusion opens a drawing window using OpenCV(2), allowing you to sketch with your mouse. Your scribble serves as a mask input for image generation (e.g., SD1.5), which runs asynchronously to generate an image. The result appears in real time as a background behind your drawing, ideally creating a continuous loop of visual inspiration.
